            <h1>Whatâ€™s your ideal first date? ðŸ’‘</h1>
            <p>Television, movies, and celebrities have left many of us with unrealistic expectations for love and dating.
                We mean, a blind date that just-so-happens to be with the world's most-eligible prince or princess? Some people have all the luck.
                It's only natural for most of us to proceed through a process of trial-and-error as we traverse the path to true love.
                But for some of us, that path can turn out to be bumpier and more winding than we'd anticipated,
                and it often tends to be paved with lots of the same type of people.
                That is to say that the key to a totally unsuccessful love life is the practice of dating the same sort of person over and over again...
                and expecting different results!
                If your love life has been dragging by in a swell of tears and rebounds, it may be time for you to step back and reconsider the type of people you're dating.
                Have you realized that your last three relationships ended over your partner's selfishness?
                Noticed that all four of the times you've been cheated on have been by people with tattoo sleeves and partially-shaved heads?
